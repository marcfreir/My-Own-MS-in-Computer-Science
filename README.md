# My-Own-MS-in-Computer-Science
This is My Own CS Master's Degree


<span style="text-align: justify;>I have attended a technical program in Computer Science and an undergraduate program at a university. I worked on some projects. I did read a lot of articles and books - but after 3 years in university and almost 3 in an institute of technology studying in the technical program in Computer Science and 2 more years studying in a technical program in Electromechanics, answering tests and quizzes and Yes, I've learned a lot, but I didn't feel all that stuff was enough for me. So I decided to take some boot camps and courses and I felt great. I still think all my effort wasn't enough, so I created my own curriculum in Computer Science selecting the best Computer Science and Data Science courses from world-class institutions like MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, Facebook, Saylor Academy, FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project and more. </span>
